<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was completed as part of coursework for Mobile Platform Development, based on the Android platform.

Project Requirements:
* A list that the user can scroll through. The list should simply display the location and strength of the earthquake
* Colour coding that displays the earthquakes from strongest to weakest
* A means of displaying more detailed information on a specific earthquake from the displayed list
* Functionality which allows the user to enter a specific date and date range. When this facility is executed the user should be presented with the following information for the day or period entered:
  * Most Northerly/Southerly/Westerly/Easterly earthquake.
  * Largest magnitude Earthquake.
  * Deepest and shallowest earthquake.
* The information that is being processed should update on a regular basis. 
* Portrait and landscape layouts that make appropriate use of the space available in that layout
* A map view which allows the user to zoom in/out to view the location of a specific earthquake. The pins should be colour coded as per the strength of the earthquake.

All of these project requirements were met.
